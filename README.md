During a course at Blekinge Institute of Technology, I learned the basics of Node.js. I thought it was very fun and decided in 2019 to try to build my own website with Node.js. The website became an extension to my Instagram account with the same name.

Now the website is inactive but it was a fun project where I got to learn more about node.js, MySQL database and the basics of CI / CD. This site was made before I had knowledge of flexbox and css grid techniques.
